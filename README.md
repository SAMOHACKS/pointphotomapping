## The Problem

Small problems in the city are often overlooked, including wall graffiti, damaged trash cans, and broken signposts. While large, outlying problems are often the center of attention, these smaller issues are regularly ignored, phasing from simple issues to our expectations for our city. 

## Our Solution

### Overview
Point Photo Mapping brings light to various problems around the city by allowing users to quickly snap a photo of any issue they see in the city. This is then added to a viewable web map which displays every user-reported problem. This would unify these seemingly separate topics into a single focus, so that they will not go unnoticed again.
